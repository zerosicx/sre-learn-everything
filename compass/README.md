# Learnings
I learnt how to make a webscraper in Python and connect it to a Convex database/backend. I created the API with typescript. I applied previously learnt knowledge to make the jobscraper into a package. I want to iterate and make a more sophisticated scraper that checks multiple websites and has application links to the jobs as well.

For further learning, I want to make a front-end that visualises the data in a nice way.
